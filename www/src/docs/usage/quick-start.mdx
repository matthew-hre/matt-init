## Create Your First Project

```bash
npx matt-init@latest
```

## Interactive Setup

The CLI will guide you through a series of prompts:

### Project Name
Set your project name. I'll be using `test-app` for this example.

### Backend Setup
Choose between full-stack or frontend-only. For this example, select `Database + Drizzle + BetterAuth`.

### Database Provider
Select your preferred database. For this example, we'll use `Turso`.

### Additional Options
Choose whatever extra tooling or configuration you want. I'll be using:
   - Nix development environment, to manage dependencies like Node, pnpm, Drizzle, sqld, etc.
   - VS Code settings, to enable linting on save, auto-formatting, and recommended extensions.
   - Initialize a Git repository, so I can track changes.
   - Install dependencies automatically.

## Running the Project

Once your project is created, make sure to `cd` into your project directory and install dependencies:

```bash
cd test-app
nix develop # Enter the Nix shell
pnpm install # Install dependencies
```

> If you're not using a Nix shell here, you'll need to install dependencies manually. Make sure to look at the <Link href="/docs/usage/databases#turso">Turso</Link> documentation for instructions on how to set up the CLI and database locally.

Finally, fire off a `pnpm dev` (or `npm run dev`) to start your development server. You'll see something like this:

```bash
[1]    ▲ Next.js 15.3.2 (Turbopack)
[1]    - Local:        http://localhost:3000
[1]    - Network:      http://192.168.1.226:3000
[1]    - Environments: .env
[1]
[0] sqld listening on port 8080.
[0] Use the following URL to configure your libSQL client SDK for local development:
[0]
[0]     http://127.0.0.1:8080
[0]
[0] Using database file local.db.
[1]  ✓ Ready in 782ms
```

A couple important things to note here:
- We're technically running two commands here. `pnpm dev` fires off `pnpm run dev:db`, which starts up Turso for us, and `next dev --turbopack`, which starts up the Next.js development server concurrently. Any database output will be prefixed with `[0]`, and Next.js output will be prefixed with `[1]`.
- The `sqld` server is running on port 8080, which is where your database is hosted. If you have anything else running on that port, you'll need to change it in your `package.json` scripts, as well as in your `.env`.
- The Next.js server is running on port 3000, which is the default port for Next.js applications. You can change this in your `package.json` scripts if needed. Once again, if you have anything else running on that port, you'll need to change it in your `package.json` and in your `.env` file.

We've got one more thing to do before we can call it a day: set up authentication. Luckily, matt-init comes with a pre-configured authentication system using [better-auth](/docs/usage/better-auth). Pop open a new terminal, (fire off a `nix develop` if needed), and run `pnpm db:push` to set up your database schema.

## Conclusion

That's it! You've got a fully functional Next.js app with a database and authentication set up in around three minutes. From here, you can start building out your features and customizing your app as needed.
