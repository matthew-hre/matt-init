## What's Nix?

Nix is a wickedly powerful package manager and build system that allows you to create reproducible development environments. It ensures that your project dependencies are consistent across different machines, making it easier to onboard new developers and maintain your codebase.

Nix uses a declarative approach to define environments, meaning you can specify exactly what tools and versions you need without worrying about conflicts or version mismatches. For matt-init projects, Nix provides a great way to manage Node.js, pnpm, and other development tools in a single configuration file.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
1. **Install Nix** - Follow the [official installation guide](https://nixos.org/download.html)
2. **Enable flakes** - Add to `~/.config/nix/nix.conf`:
```
experimental-features = nix-command flakes
```

### Entering the Development Shell
```bash
# Enter the development shell
nix develop
```

> **Note**: If this is your first time using Nix, you may not appreciate how sick that just was: in a single command, you installed all the necessary tools for your project, down to the exact version, and entered a shell with them available. It. Just. Works.

### What You Get
When you enter the shell, you'll have access to:
- **Node.js**
- **pnpm** (latest stable)
- **Development tools** (alejandra for formatting, sqld if you're using Turso, etc.)

## Configuration

### Main Flake (flake.nix)

This isn't the exciting part. This file is the entry point for your Nix configuration. It defines the inputs (like nixpkgs and flake-utils) and outputs (like development shells and formatters).

```nix
{
  description = "my-cool-app";

  inputs = {
    nixpkgs.url = "github:nixos/nixpkgs/release-24.11";
    flake-utils.url = "github:numtide/flake-utils";
  };

  outputs = {
    self,
    flake-utils,
    nixpkgs,
    ...
  }:
    flake-utils.lib.eachDefaultSystem (
      system: let
        pkgs = import nixpkgs {inherit system;};
      in {
        devShell = pkgs.callPackage ./nix/devShell.nix {};
        formatter = pkgs.alejandra;
      }
    );
}

```

### Development Shell (nix/devShell.nix)

Here's the meat and potatoes of your Nix setup. This file defines the development environment, including all the tools you need for your project. As an example, here's the devShell for a project using Turso:

```nix
{
  mkShell,
  alejandra,
  bash,
  nodejs,
  pnpm,
  turso-cli,
  sqld,
}:
mkShell rec {
  name = "my-cool-app";

  packages = [
    bash
    nodejs
    pnpm

    # Required for CI for format checking.
    alejandra

    turso-cli
    sqld
  ];
}
```

## Common Operations

### Adding New Tools
Edit `nix/devShell.nix` to add more development tools:

```nix
{
  ...,
  newPackageINeeded,
  ...,
}:
mkShell rec {
  name = "my-cool-app";

  packages = [
    ...
    newPackageINeeded
    ...
  ];
}
```

### Updating Dependencies
```bash
# Update all inputs to latest
nix flake update

# Update specific input
nix flake lock --update-input nixpkgs

# Check what changed
nix flake lock --update-input nixpkgs --print-build-logs
```
