## `.env`

Your `.env` file is generated dynamically during setup. It contains the environment variables needed for the backend, auth, and local dev tooling.

Example:

```env
NODE_ENV=development
TURSO_DATABASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8080
TURSO_AUTH_TOKEN= # not needed for local development
BETTER_AUTH_SECRET=abcd1234...
BETTER_AUTH_URL=https://localhost:3000
```

### What each of these does:

* `NODE_ENV` — Usually set to `development`, but overridden in production.
* `TURSO_DATABASE_URL` — Your local or remote SQLite-compatible database URL.
* `TURSO_AUTH_TOKEN` — Used when connecting to a remote Turso DB. Leave blank locally.
* `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` — Secret key used for encrypting auth tokens. You can generate one using `openssl rand -hex 32`.
* `BETTER_AUTH_URL` — The base URL of your app, used by BetterAuth for redirects and cookie handling.

> **Note:** `.env` values are type-checked at runtime using Zod via `src/lib/env.ts`. Missing or invalid values will cause the app to fail fast during boot.

## `drizzle.config.ts`

Handles Drizzle ORM configuration for migrations and schema paths.

Things you might tweak:

* Change the `dialect` if you're switching off Turso
* Customize `out` if you want migrations in a different folder

---

## `package.json`

Everything here is ready to go, but worth knowing:

* Scripts like `pnpm db:push`, `pnpm db:migrate`, `pnpm db:generate`, `pnpm db:studio`, and `pnpm dev` are set up for local development with Turso and Drizzle.
* `pnpm dev` runs both the Next.js dev server and a Turso dev DB concurrently (if backend is enabled).

---

## `src/lib/env.ts`

This handles env var validation using Zod. If you add new environment variables, you should update this schema to match.

```ts
const EnvSchema = z.object({
  NODE_ENV: z.string(),
  TURSO_DATABASE_URL: z.string(),
  TURSO_AUTH_TOKEN: z.string(),
  BETTER_AUTH_SECRET: z.string(),
  BETTER_AUTH_URL: z.string(),
});
```

---

## `src/lib/db/schema/`

This is where your Drizzle schemas live. If you're building out your app's models, this is where to do it. It already includes basic `user`, `session`, and `account` tables used by BetterAuth.

---

## `flake.nix` / `nix/devShell.nix`

Only relevant if you enabled the `--nix` flag. These define your development shell and toolchain.

* Want to add a CLI tool like `jq` or `sqlite-utils`? Add it to `devShell.nix`.
* Want to pin a different version of Node or PNPM? Adjust it here.

---

## `eslint.config.mjs`

Based on `@antfu/eslint-config`, with extra rules for filename casing, import sorting, and strict formatting. If you need to tweak a rule, this is where it lives.

---

## `.vscode/`

If you opted in, this includes:

* Recommended extensions (`extensions.json`)
* Project-specific settings like formatting on save, auto-imports, etc. (`settings.json`)
