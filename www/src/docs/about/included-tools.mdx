## Core Stack (Every Project)

### Next.js 15
- **What it is:** React framework with App Router, Server Components, and modern features
- **Why I chose it:** Production-ready, excellent DX, strong ecosystem, and I already know it
- **Version:** 15.3.2 with Turbopack

### TypeScript
- **What it is:** Typed superset of JavaScript
- **Why I chose it:** Catches errors early, improves code quality, excellent IDE support
- **Configuration:** Strict mode enabled with path aliases (`~/` instead of `../../../`)

### Tailwind CSS v4
- **What it is:** Utility-first CSS framework
- **Why I chose it:** Rapid styling, consistent design, excellent developer experience
- **Configuration:** CSS-based configuration (no separate config file needed)

### ESLint + @antfu/eslint-config
- **What it is:** Comprehensive linting setup with opinionated rules
- **Why I chose it:** Enforces code quality, catches common mistakes, formats code consistently
- **Includes:** React rules, TypeScript rules, import sorting, filename conventions

## Environment & Validation

### Zod
- **What it is:** TypeScript-first schema declaration and validation library
- **Why I chose it:** Type-safe environment variables, runtime validation, great DX
- **Usage:** Environment variable validation in `src/lib/env.ts`

### Environment Management
- **What it is:** Type-safe environment variable handling
- **Why I chose it:** Fail-fast on missing config, prevents runtime errors, godsend in production
- **Files:** `.env`, `.env.example`, `src/lib/env.ts`

## Development Tools

### VS Code Integration (Optional)
- **What it is:** Workspace settings and recommended extensions
- **Why I chose it:** Consistent team experience, auto-formatting, helpful extensions
- **Includes:** ESLint, Tailwind IntelliSense, TypeScript optimizations

### Nix Development Environment (Optional)
- **What it is:** Reproducible development shell with all dependencies
- **Why I chose it:** Consistent environment across machines, version pinning
- **Includes:** Node.js, pnpm, database tools (when backend enabled)

## Backend Stack (Optional)

### Drizzle ORM
- **What it is:** TypeScript ORM with excellent developer experience
- **Why I chose it:** Type-safe database queries, excellent migrations, lightweight
- **Learn more:** [Drizzle documentation](/docs/usage/drizzle)

### Turso Database
- **What it is:** Edge-compatible SQLite database
- **Why I chose it:** Fast, scalable, works everywhere, great for development
- **Learn more:** [Database documentation](/docs/usage/databases)

### Better Auth
- **What it is:** Modern authentication library for TypeScript
- **Why I chose it:** Type-safe, framework agnostic, extensive provider support
- **Learn more:** [Better Auth documentation](/docs/usage/better-auth)

## Why These Tools?

There's no method to my madness, these tools were chosen truly based on my personal preferences and experience. I wanted to create a stack that I would find myself throwing together during a weekend project, or something I would use to build a side project. This probably means this isn't the most opimized or efficient stack, but it is one that I know works well together and provides a solid developer experience.

## What's NOT Included

### UI Component Libraries
- No shadcn/ui, Chakra UI, or other component libraries by default
- You can add these later based on your needs (they are also in the roadmap, eyes peeled!)

### State Management
- No Redux, Zustand, or other global state libraries
- Start with React's built-in state, add complexity only when needed

### Testing Frameworks
- No Jest, Vitest, or testing libraries by default
- Add testing setup based on your project requirements
- Writing unit tests triggers a post-trauma response in me, so I don't include them here

### Additional Databases
- Only Turso (SQLite) is currently implemented
- Neon (Postgres) and Docker Postgres are planned for future releases
