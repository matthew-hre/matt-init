# Included Tools

Every matt-init project comes pre-configured with a carefully selected set of tools and technologies. Here's what's included and why:

## Core Stack (Every Project)

### **Next.js 15**
- **What it is:** React framework with App Router, Server Components, and modern features
- **Why I chose it:** Production-ready, excellent DX, strong ecosystem
- **Version:** 15.3.2 with Turbopack for fast development

### **TypeScript**
- **What it is:** Typed superset of JavaScript
- **Why I chose it:** Catches errors early, improves code quality, excellent IDE support
- **Configuration:** Strict mode enabled with path aliases (`~/` instead of `../../../`)

### **Tailwind CSS v4**
- **What it is:** Utility-first CSS framework
- **Why I chose it:** Rapid styling, consistent design, excellent developer experience
- **Configuration:** CSS-based configuration (no separate config file needed)

### **ESLint + @antfu/eslint-config**
- **What it is:** Comprehensive linting setup with opinionated rules
- **Why I chose it:** Enforces code quality, catches common mistakes, formats code consistently
- **Includes:** React rules, TypeScript rules, import sorting, filename conventions

## Environment & Validation

### **Zod**
- **What it is:** TypeScript-first schema declaration and validation library
- **Why I chose it:** Type-safe environment variables, runtime validation, great DX
- **Usage:** Environment variable validation in `src/lib/env.ts`

### **Environment Management**
- **What it is:** Type-safe environment variable handling
- **Why I chose it:** Fail-fast on missing config, prevents runtime errors
- **Files:** `.env`, `.env.example`, `src/lib/env.ts`

## Development Tools

### **VS Code Integration** (Optional)
- **What it is:** Workspace settings and recommended extensions
- **Why I chose it:** Consistent team experience, auto-formatting, helpful extensions
- **Includes:** ESLint, Tailwind IntelliSense, TypeScript optimizations

### **Nix Development Environment** (Optional)
- **What it is:** Reproducible development shell with all dependencies
- **Why I chose it:** Consistent environment across machines, version pinning
- **Includes:** Node.js, pnpm, database tools (when backend enabled)

## Backend Stack (Optional)

### **Drizzle ORM**
- **What it is:** TypeScript ORM with excellent developer experience
- **Why I chose it:** Type-safe database queries, excellent migrations, lightweight
- **Learn more:** [Drizzle documentation](/docs/usage/drizzle)

### **Turso Database**
- **What it is:** Edge-compatible SQLite database
- **Why I chose it:** Fast, scalable, works everywhere, great for development
- **Learn more:** [Database documentation](/docs/usage/databases)

### **Better Auth**
- **What it is:** Modern authentication library for TypeScript
- **Why I chose it:** Type-safe, framework agnostic, extensive provider support
- **Learn more:** [Better Auth documentation](/docs/usage/better-auth)

## Why These Tools?

### **Opinionated by Design**
matt-init deliberately limits choices to avoid decision fatigue. These tools work well together and provide a solid foundation for most projects.

### **Battle-Tested**
All tools are proven in production environments and have active communities and maintenance.

### **Type Safety First**
Every tool in the stack prioritizes TypeScript integration and type safety, reducing runtime errors.

### **Developer Experience**
Tools are chosen for their excellent documentation, helpful error messages, and overall developer experience.

## What's NOT Included

### **UI Component Libraries**
- No shadcn/ui, Chakra UI, or other component libraries by default
- You can add these later based on your needs

### **State Management**
- No Redux, Zustand, or other global state libraries
- Start with React's built-in state, add complexity only when needed

### **Testing Frameworks**
- No Jest, Vitest, or testing libraries by default
- Add testing setup based on your project requirements

### **Additional Databases**
- Only Turso (SQLite) is currently implemented
- Neon (Postgres) and Docker Postgres are planned for future releases
